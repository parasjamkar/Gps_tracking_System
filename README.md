# GPS Traffic Analysis and Optimization

## **Project Overview**
This project analyzes GPS data collected from 10 devices over 3 months to study traffic patterns in Delhi. The insights aim to improve urban planning, reduce congestion, and optimize transportation routes.

---

## **Key Objectives**
- Analyze GPS data to identify traffic patterns, dwell areas, and trip routes.
- Integrate GPS data with external geographic datasets (e.g., Google Open Buildings).
- Provide actionable insights for urban planning and route optimization.

---

## **Data Description**
- **Source**: GPS navigation data from 10 devices over a 3-month period.
- **Fields**: Latitude, longitude, timestamp, and device ID.
- **External Dataset**: Google Open Buildings dataset for spatial analysis.

---

## **Key Features**
- **Data Preprocessing**: Cleaned and structured GPS data for analysis.
- **Trip and Dwell Detection**: Identified frequent stops (dwell areas) and mapped routes.
- **Visualization**: Created heatmaps, route maps, and other visualizations using Folium and GeoPandas.
- **Integration**: Merged GPS data with geographic datasets for enhanced spatial insights.

---

## **Technical Tools Used**
- **Python Libraries**: Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, GeoPandas, Folium.
- **Algorithms**: DBSCAN for clustering dwell areas, spatial joins for integration.

---

## **Results and Applications**
- **Traffic Insights**: Identified high-congestion zones and peak traffic hours.
- **Urban Planning**: Insights for better infrastructure and traffic signal optimization.
- **Route Optimization**: Suggested efficient alternate routes to reduce delays.

## **Project Structure**
1. **Data Loading and Cleaning**:
   - Extracted GPS data from zip files.
   - Preprocessed timestamps and filtered erroneous data points.

2. **Dwell and Trip Detection**:
   - Clustered dwell points using DBSCAN.
   - Mapped frequent routes and analyzed trip durations.

3. **Geographic Integration**:
   - Integrated GPS data with Google Open Buildings.
   - Conducted spatial joins and proximity analysis.

4. **Visualization**:
   - Heatmaps of dwell areas.
   - Route maps and trip start/end visualizations.
